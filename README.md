# Team-Profile-Builder


## Description

The Team Profile Builder is a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. The Inquirer and Jest Packages were also used. A walkthrough previewing the application's functionality is available at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xc0JYwOVBE8VvC4cqwI9KYJP2p2nfS4c/view.
